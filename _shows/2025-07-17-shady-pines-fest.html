  <p>We will be headlining the opening day of the festival, closing it down on the Rainbow Stage late on <b>THURSDAY NIGHT</b>, midnight to 1am, and this shit is gonna be so wild and fun! We really want you to come out early and get wacky with us!</p>

  <p>The thing is, at the moment, the only way to see us play on Thursday night is to get a full weekend pass. There are day passes for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, but not for Thursday. We know, it's a bit of a sticky wicket, a real wicked googly!</p>

  <p>But <b>the good news</b> is that we've got a killer <em>20%-off coupon code</em> that you should use at checkout, which will bring your total for an entire weekend of <em>music and camping</em> to only $120! It's an incredible deal, you'd be a fool not to take advantage of it.</p>

  <p>So grab that coupon code, click that link, and get your tickets <b>now</b> because this super sweet deal is only good until June 15th. Make it happen, captain!</p>

  <p>Big thanks again to Shady Pines Radio for tossing us into the mix. We are very excited to share the bill with so many amazing Portland bands. Seriously, <a href="https://www.shadypinesradio.com/festival-schedule" target="_blank">check out this jam-packed schedule of amazing local talent</a>. You gotta make it happen!</p>
