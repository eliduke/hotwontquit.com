  <p>We will be headlining the opening day of the festival, closing it down on the Rainbow Stage late on <b>THURSDAY NIGHT</b>, midnight to 1am, and this shit is gonna be so wild and fun. We <em>really</em> want you to come out early and get wacky with us!</p>

  <p>The Thursday night festivities are included in the weekend pass, so you might as well commit and make a whole weekend of it <em>obviously</em>. The pass includes camping and festivities and joy and merriment. PLUS! This is going to be such an epoch collection of amazing local talent you DO NOT WANT TO MISS IT. But, if the whole weekend is too much for you to commit, let us know! We might be able to work something out. ;) </p>
